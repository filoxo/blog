First, I want to make it clear that these opinions are my own and reflect on only my experience. My employer is actually a very place to work if you can get your foot in the door. This complaint is with the **hiring process** only. There are some major issues with the hiring process that have made me extremely frustrated, to the point where I want to gripe about it.

### Into the void

I've had many people reach out to me about applying, and as a developer there isn't much more that I can do apart from generating a referral code (which I suspect is weighted slightly higher in our HR system) and give some general advice to prep for an interview.

The problem that has me frustrated is that after one of these friends or aquaintances applies, there's little to no follow up on the company side. Only 13% of my referrals ever even received a response. The rest have sat in our recruiting system(s) as "inactive" or "pending recruiter response". What bothers me about this is that this can be automated! Fire off an 'Application Received' email; send a 'Thank you for applying' once the position is filled; Deliver a 'Sorry about the lack of response' message if an application has sat for X weeks without any recruiter activity. Because this is so easy and common-place at other companies, I find it extremely rude to applicants. This is a very bad look.&nbsp;ðŸ‘Ž
