I believe that developers can benefit and learn from others' favorite suite of tools. I'll go over my favorite applications that help me be as efficient and quick while working on a Mac.

### BetterTouchTool

I find [BetterTouchTool](http://www.bettertouchtool.net/) better than using [BetterSnapTool](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bettersnaptool/id417375580?mt=12), [SizeUp](http://www.irradiatedsoftware.com/sizeup/), or [Spectacle](http://spectacleapp.com/) for one simple reason: it also includes keyboard/gesture customizations per app and globally. Don't get me wrong, they're all pretty great window managers. BetterSnapTool has some more features than BetterTouchTool, but BTT does all that I need it to. Right out of the box, you can define window snapping behavior, such as:

- Snap when dragged to window edge (left, right, top)
- Restore window size when dragged away
- Animate preview window

That's really all I need because I wanted to replicate Window's AeroSnap functionality that is missing from OSX. But my workflow is also enhanced by adding custom shortcuts that can remap and shorten existing ones, or adds new ones. Here are a few that I can't live without:

- Global
    - <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>→</kbd> : Snap window to right
    - <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>←</kbd> : Snap window to left
    - <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>↑</kbd> : Maximize window
    - Press <kbd>⌥</kbd><kbd>⌃</kbd><kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>8</kbd> to invert or revert the screen colors

- Chrome specific
    - <kbd>F12</kbd> was remapped to run <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>⌥</kbd><kbd>I</kbd> to bring up the Developer tools like on Windows
- Firefox specific
    - I borrowed Chrome's <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>⇧</kbd><kbd>N</kbd> to remap Firefox's keyboard shortcut (<kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>⇧</kbd><kbd>P</kbd>) for opening a new window in Private mode. This way I only need to remember one shortcut
- Finder
    - I don't know why swipe navigation in Finder isn't already built in; it makes sense to have it.
    - "2 finger swipe right" in Finder will trigger <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>[</kbd> which is the hidden keyboard shortcut for "back". Yay for less work!
    - Similarly "2 finger swipe left" will trigger <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>]</kbd> to navigate forward.

### Sip

Sometimes I just need to know the HEX or RGB value of a color I see online, in an image, or on an application and [Sip](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sip/id507257563?mt=12) is my tool of choice. To pick a color, a magnifier shows up for precise color selection. You can copy the selected color value/code in an unbelievable amount of formats.


The Pro version costs $9.99 from the App Store. Since this one is only for Mac, you might also check out ColorCop on my Windows post.

### iTerm2

I recently switched from [TotalTerminal](http://totalterminal.binaryage.com/) to [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) because I need something a little bit more customizable. The two are not the same: TotalTerminal is a plugin that creates hotkeys for Mac's `Terminal.app`. iTerm2 is a replacement for Terminal.app, and as such offers quite a bit more in terms of changing colors schemes, appearance, hotkeys and gestures, and even provides tabs. If you use the console a lot, I recommend at least giving iTerm2 a try.
