I believe that developers can benefit and learn from others' favorite suite of tools. I'll go over my favorite applications that help me be as efficient and quick while working on a Mac.

### F.lux

[F.lux](https://justgetflux.com/) is a great example of cross-platform compatibility. It comes with presets that are fine enough for me, and is available for Mac, Windows, and Linux. I installed it on my two computers that I use regularly, one a Mac and the other running Windows. The peeps at F.lux have gone through a lot of research to set the foundation of why their application is so useful. This is a must for anyone on their computer passed 6pm.
The've recently released an Android Beta app, but might become superseded by Apple's Night Shift and Android N's Night Mode.

### KeePass

Alright here's one that I've debated with friends about. There are alternatives like LastPass and 1Password, but I'm always one to avoid paying money. [KeePass](http://keepass.info/) is my favorite so far for several reasons.

- It is free and open-source software. Freedom!
- It is cross-platform. Use it on Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS, Windows Phone, Chromebook, and even BlackBerry.
- They all use the same database filetype. You could save your database file to the cloud using Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox, etc. and use the same file among multiple clients.
- Use in conjunction with [chromeIPass](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromeipass/ompiailgknfdndiefoaoiligalphfdae?hl=en) (Chrome extension) or [PassIFox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/passifox/) (Firefox add-on) to populate your credentials into login inputs if a URL is matched to an entry's site field.

### PushBullet

I really couldn't stand to use the iPhone (personal preference!) despite its great interoperability with the Macbook. [PushBullet](https://www.pushbullet.com/) makes up for that loss by allowing me to receive notifications from my phone while on my computer, as well as letting me respond directly to text messages. An additional bonus is that I can use this on my Windows machine as well as other Android devices (think tablet). This way, I can see my notifications and respond to texts from literally any of my devices. Lastly, it allows me to push things like notes, links, and files between devices as well. Send a link from my phone to my desktop, push a new background image from my phone to my tablet, whatever. Its awesome!

### Synergy

[Synergy](http://synergy-project.org/) is a super handy utility that bridges multiple computers so that you can share one keyboard and mouse between them. You can use them multiple machines with the same keyboard, copy and paste from one to the other, and even transfer files using drag-n-drop (ahem, sorry. Between Windows-Mac only). Need it for enterprise? You can use the Pro version to encrypt your traffic using SSL. Its absolutely necessary if you work on different machines.
