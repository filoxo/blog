i've went on a reading spree while on vacation last week, diving into stories that have been so unexpectedly interesting, emtionally charged, and have left me thinking.

<!-- excerpt-end -->

## _Murderbot_ series, Martha Wells

i started this series per a friend's recommendation and it's been a _fantastic_ read. i really identified with the perspective of the main character who exists in the intersection of being mostly human and being uncomfortable with that. i've learned more about [audhd](https://behavioral-innovations.com/blog/the-sudden-rise-of-audhd/) and at least strongly identify with the advice given for those who are struggling with it.

i also really enjoyed the murderbot's uberpragmatic personality and dry anger. binged 4 of these already and still have two more to go.

## _Legion_, Brandon Sanderson

i wasn't really sure what to expect from this book as i solely picked it up because it was a Brandon Sanderson story. it was really cool how this version of "legion" incoporated the aspect of 'many personalities/one mind' and made it a superpower. very Sherlock Holmes-like. the latter half of the book hit me with an emotional weight that i didn't expect, and loved strulgging through it.

## _Binti_ series, Nnedi Okorafor

this was recommended to me in a book club discord. the first book was hard for me to follow at the start. but once I did get about halfway through, i was **sold**. you are tossed right in to the upheaval that binti has to pass through on her way to becoming a harmonizer. my main struggle was keeping track of the names and words for things. i read all three books consequitively which i recommend. The unredeption/antihero had me feeling so much: anger, sadness, longing, loss. it was a really good read!

## _Daring Greatly_, Brené Brown

i've been a big fan of Brené Brown for a long time. this was available last minute so i also picked it up for my week long vacation. do not regret it one bit – she's inspiring, and i learned how necessary it is for me to learn how to "live wholeheartedly". i also went ahead and picked up her book called _the gifts of imperfection_.

## _The Reckoning_, John Grisham

i grabbed this book because of two reasons: it was immediately available, and I've seen a lot of John Grisham books in my ex father-in-law's library. i really didn't know what to expect and this story had a really cool build up. also almost felt like a historical fiction, which was cool. the resolution at the end hit me like a train. to be honest, i _still_ can't believe it ended that way. looking forward to trying another from this author as well!

## _The Giver_, Lois Lowry

this is a great dystopian story and I was so much more invested and interested in the original story. i recalled seeing the movie this was based on but didn't realize it was a book... and that there were more in the series as well. going to read the rest of the series asap as well!
