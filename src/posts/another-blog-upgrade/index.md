its been 2 years since i've had to make updates and i was reflecting on what i got out of it.

<!-- excerpt-end -->

1. 11ty v2's [incremental builds](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/usage/incremental/)
2. [unocss](https://unocss.dev/) to replace Tailwind
3. excited for 11ty v3

the first is meh, i didn't really have much of a problem with build perf. 

unocss is pretty much a drop in replacement for tailwind, as it follows all the same conventions as the main projects while being so much more customizable. i've been using tailwind/unocss classes at work and i think its paid off dividends that a lot of people don't realize!

and last, i'm pretty excited for **11ty v3** because it introduces [bundler-free ESM support](https://www.11ty.dev/blog/canary-eleventy-v3/)! i've been longing for the days of esm everywhere
