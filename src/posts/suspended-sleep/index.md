i've recently been making personal changes in order to improve my mental health. sleep itself hasn't been an issue recently so much as what i was feeling when considering the bed i sleep on. Its too big for me. And it had eventually become a second wardrobe. And seeing it made sparks joy. but unmade... it sparks unjoy so i have to change it. while talking to my mom recently, she told me about how often she falls asleep on her hammock in mexico. i hadn't considered that maybe... i just don't want a bed anymore so i'm giving that a try. this post is a test to see if i use a hammock as my primary sleep arrangement for a week, and what I learn/find along the way.

# day 1

was not able to sleep through the night because i got too hot, as the heater in my room was pointed right at me. however i noticed that my neck didn't hurt at the end of the day, and couldn't even crack them.

# day 2

was not able to sleep throught the night because i got cold. at one point i could feel a large cold spot on my bad where i didn't have blanket coverage. need better tempurature regulation.

# day 3

went to bed late-ish. used two blankets, worked much better. slept through the night just fine! neck is still much more limber than usual which is interesting since my neck feels less supported while laying.
