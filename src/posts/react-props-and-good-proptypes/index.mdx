## Care about the right things

don't validate native html dom attributes unless absolutely necessary

## Use the right PropTypes

React.element vs React.node

React.shapeOf

## PropTypes don't protect your internal state

Remember that PropTypes are only checked at the component props boundary. What this means is that while your data may come in as a specific type, your component may be changing that type unknowingly.
