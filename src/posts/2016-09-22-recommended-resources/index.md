There are lots of great resources out there for the front-end developer who wants to keep learning. I know that I've been able to glean much just from joining and listening to the right sources. Here's a list of my favorite people/blogs/podcasts to listen to. Get ready for a huge link list!

## Twitter

There are a ton of really smart people on Twitter, most of whom I don't get a chance to talk to on a regular basis (if ever, actually). But I can "listen in" on their public conversations and chime in when I have something to offer.

I've grouped these people by the main topics they talk about.

#### Javascript

- <a href="https://twitter.com/marcysutton" class="link">Marcy Sutton</a> - Sr A11Y engineer & guru
- <a href="https://twitter.com/sarah_edo" class="link">Sarah Drasner</a> - Sr developer, speaker/writer

#### Angular 2

#### News

#### Tools

- <a href="https://twitter.com/eggheadio" class="link">Egghead.io</a>

I'm sure I missed some people on this list. It can't be comprehensive. But hopefully its a start for you.

Consider also following any of the accounts for meetups in your local area. For example, here in Utah where I live, <a href="https://twitter.com/utjs" class="link">UtahJS</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/reactjsutah" class="link">ReactJS Utah</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/IonicUtah" class="link">Ionic Utah</a> are on my radar too.

## Blogs

Blogs are great for laying out a lot of content/ideas so they take more time to consume. Time is of the essence and I generally won't read a blog post unless its very interesting to me. Here are the ones I watch.

- <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/coolgithubprojects" class="link">r/coolgithubprojects</a>)
- <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/" class="link">r/SideProject</a>
- <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/" class="link">r/webdev</a>
- <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Angular2/" class="link">r/angular2</a>
- <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/" class="link">r/reactjs</a>
- <a href="https://frontendfront.com/" class="link">Front end Front</a>
- <a href="https://css-tricks.com/" class="link">CSS Tricks</a>
- <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/" class="link">Smashing Magazine</a>
- <a href="https://medium.com/on-Coding" class="link">On Coding - Medium</a>

#### News

News outlets aren't blogs really, but its great to stay in the loop about technology in general. Oh Twitter is looking to sell? Microsoft has the most open-source contributors on Gihutb? What's Google's latest hardware project? It's a good idea to be generally informed on technology.
