There are lots of great resources out there for the front-end developer who wants to keep learning. I know that I've been able to glean much just from joining and listening to the right sources. Here's a list of my favorite people/blogs/podcasts to listen to. Get ready for a huge link list!

## Twitter
There are a ton of really smart people on Twitter, most of whom I don't get a chance to talk to on a regular basis (if ever, actually). But I can "listen in" on their public conversations and chime in when I have something to offer.

I've grouped these people by the main topics they talk about.

#### Javascript
- [Eric Elliott](https://twitter.com/_ericelliott) -  practical advice, smart writing
- [Mattias Johansson](https://twitter.com/mpjme) - also check out his Youtube channel, 'Fun Fun Function'

#### React
- [Dan Abramov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov) - main author of Redux
- [Ryan Florence](https://twitter.com/ryanflorence) - main contributor to React Router
- [Michael Jackson](https://twitter.com/mjackson) - main contributor to React Router
- [James Kyle](https://twitter.com/thejameskyle) - Facebook developer
- [Kent Dodds](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds) - all around savvy guy

#### Angular 2
- [Victor Savkin](https://twitter.com/victorsavkin) - main architect of Angular Router
- [Patrick Stapleton](https://twitter.com/gdi2290) - contributor to Angular Universal, Angular Class

#### Other
- [Marcy Sutton](https://twitter.com/marcysutton) - A11Y guru
- [Sarah Drasner](https://twitter.com/sarah_edo) - CSS/web afficionada

#### News
- [JS Daily](https://twitter.com/JavaScriptDaily)
- [Front-End Front](https://twitter.com/frontendfront)

#### Tools
- [Chrome Developers](https://twitter.com/ChromiumDev)
- [Egghead.io](https://twitter.com/eggheadio)

I'm sure I missed some people on this list. It can't be comprehensive. But hopefully its a start for you.

Consider also following any of the accounts for meetups in your local area. For example, here in Utah where I live, [UtahJS](https://twitter.com/utjs), [ReactJS Utah](https://twitter.com/reactjsutah), [Ionic Utah](https://twitter.com/IonicUtah) are on my radar too.

## Blogs

Blogs are great for laying out a lot of content/ideas so they take more time to consume. Time is of the essence and I generally won't read a blog post unless its very interesting to me. Here are the ones I watch.

- [r/coolgithubprojects](https://www.reddit.com/r/coolgithubprojects/)
- [r/SideProject](https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/)
- [r/webdev](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/)
- [r/angular2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Angular2/)
- [r/reactjs](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/)
- [Front end Front](https://frontendfront.com/)
- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/)
- [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/)
- [On Coding - Medium](https://medium.com/on-Coding)

#### News
News outlets aren't blogs really, but its great to stay in the loop about technology in general. Oh Twitter is looking to sell? Microsoft has the most open-source contributors on Gihutb? What's Google's latest hardware project? It's a good idea to be generally informed on technology.
