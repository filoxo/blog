I recently started a new job and was able to request a new keyboard. I got the Anne Pro with Gateron Red switches, and have mostly liked it. I still felt like there were some improvements to be made, so I took a stab at it.

### Foam mod

I noticed that the plastic case is pretty loud when bottoming out. It sounds like a loud, dull thud. It was honestly not too bad but I'm more of a fan of silent keyboards at work. 

I was able to get some &frac14;" foam padding from a friend, and cut it up to the dimensions of the case bottom. This was pretty straightforward, just cut the holes for the case screws and the reset button. This reduces the thunking greatly. 

### Replaced switches

I replaced the default Gateron Red switches with some modified Kailh Heavy Dark Yellow switches that I purchased from r/mechmarket for cheaper than retail. 40 of these switches were lubricated and had a 80g springs, the rest were factory stock 70g. 

Surprisingly, heavy springs are helping me become a better touch typist since its harder to bottom out. My hands do get more tired after typing for a long time, but I don't write novels and even typing this post hasn't fatigued my hands much. 

### Clipped and stuffed stabilizers

Most of the rattle noise is due to the stabilizers. While the switches were removed, I took apart the stabs. I clipped them to reduce the amount of parts that touch, and "stuffed" them with thin foam padding to reduce the movement even more. They are now much quieter and help me keep my sanity! I wondered if stabilizer grease would have been better but I'm very happy now. 

### Additional modifications

There are 2 additional modifications I'll be adding in the future: installing a dedicated hardware switch, and changing the firmware.

I've already purchased a cheap hardware switch for this and am just waiting for it to arrive. 

The firmware is still under heavy development and isn't feature-complete enough to use as a daily driver, unfortunately. Keep checking in on this project though. It's making lots of progress!
