hey there, i’m Carlos. i use this space to jot down ideas and thoughts relating to my work as a software dev, hobbies, and life in general to build a habit of sharing what i’ve learned. most of what you’ll find is about programming, mixed in with the occasional personal story or reflection. i’m not trying to impress anyone — just hoping to be useful, maybe even familiar. thanks for reading.
